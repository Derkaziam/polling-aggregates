## Welcome to Derk's Polls

## Polling Aggregates

I have a whole host of elections, from the UK, US, and more! Message me on Discord (Derkaziam#4790) to request an aggregate.

Aggregates will be updated either weekly or bi-weekly. This is all run by one person, so I might not be able to get everything updated on time!

### Method

Polls are first taken from one of a handful of sources; including FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and Wikipedia. They are then averaged by day, days without polls are computed using a simple forumla. To get the final aggregate polls are put through a 14-day average based on recency.
